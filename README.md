# PVR_CLONE_PROJECT

This is a responsive front-end clone of the PVR Cinemas movie booking website, built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The project showcases a modern and interactive UI for browsing and booking movies. It simulates key features like movie listings, trailer previews, quick booking options, city selection, and real-time date display.
